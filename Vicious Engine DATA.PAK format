Pak files have 3 key components:
A header, A file table, and a file data area.

The header contains 4 values:
0x00000 Size of directory table
0x00004 pointer to file name strings relative to the start of the file table
0x00008 block number where the file table is stored within the pack file
0x0000c block size used by this pack file

Typical data.pak files use block size 0x0800, and place the file table at block 1, which places it at 0x0800.
The file table has two types of records: directory records, and file records.  It always starts with a directory record that represents the root (/). 
Directory records are 0x18 bytes long and contain 4 fields:
0x0000 pointer to the directory name, relative to the start of directory strings in the pack file header
0x0004 block number where data for files in this directory begin.  If the directory has no files, it points to the next block that does contain file data.
0x0008 number of files in the directory
0x0010 number of subdirectories

File records have 2 fields, the file name pointer, and the file size in bytes.
0x0000 pointer to the file name relative to the start of directory strings, and also a flag determining the file name type.  0x0--- indicates the file name is stored as a string. 0x8--- indicates the filename is hex and stored in hex format. Hex formatted file names are read back and formatted with "%08x%08x.%s", stored as two little endian fields and the extention string.
0x0004 size of the file in bytesno 

The order in which records appear is specific:
Root dir
 - Files
 - Subdirectories
  [ first subdirectory ]
     - files
     - subdirectories
  [ â€¦ ]
 
The directory tree is recursively iterated through in that order.

The file data area is arranged in blocks, with the block size stored in the header.  File data always starts at the beginning of a block, empty space between files is zero filled. If the file ends on a block boundary there will be no gap between files.
